# android-studio-vip-templates
We are going to look at how to create a custom group of file templates for creating `VIP Clean Android Kotlin` functionality. We need to create a `Presenter`, an `Activity`, a `Router` and a `Worker` that defines the interfaces between the five.


## 1. Check-out project
You can clone/download resource from git

## 2. Integrate into Android Studio
- Navigate to the location of the templates folder :

  + For `Window`:
    ``` 
    {ANDROID_STUDIO_LOCATION}/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/
    ```
 
  + For `MAC OS`:
    ```
    /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/
    ```

 - Copy `VIPStructureTemplate`and then paste in here
 
 - Restart Android Studio, and then when you right click on a folder to create a new file, you will be able to see the new option to create a `VIP Clean Android Kotlin` structure.
